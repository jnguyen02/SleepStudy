# SleepStudy

Analyzing a sleep-study dataset from kaggle using plots and queries in R. 

**All of the information is found in the 'study of sleep' pdf file attached here. The csv file contains the dataset.**

DISCLAIMER: Conclusions found here should not be taken as definitive facts. The author did not reference any studies, so I am unsure about the legitimacy of the data. This was merely a fun experiment to gain a better understanding of data analysis and familiarize myself with p-values and other tools.
