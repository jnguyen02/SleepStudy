# SleepStudy

Analyzing a sleep-study dataset from kaggle using plots and queries in R. 

**SleepStudyData.csv** - contains the dataset<br>
**sleepstudy.R** - contains the queries and code to plot the information retreive from dataset. <br>
**THE STUDY OF SLEEP.pdf** - Analysis and conclusion of the dataset.<br>


DISCLAIMER: Conclusions found here should not be taken as definitive facts. The author did not reference any studies, so I am unsure about the legitimacy of the data. This was merely a fun experiment to gain a better understanding of data analysis and familiarize myself with p-values and other tools.
